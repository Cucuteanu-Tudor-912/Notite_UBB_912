# Relations

## Definition
A triple $r = (A, B, R)$, where $A, B$ are sets and 
$R \subseteq A \times B = \{ (a,b)\ |\ a \in A,\ b \in B \}$
is called a **relation**
#### Domain
Set $A$ is the **Domain**
#### Codomain
Set $B$ is the **Codomain**
#### Graph
Set $R$ is the **Graph** of the relation $r$

## Properties
if $A=B$ then relation $r$ is called **Homogenous**

## Notations
let $(a,b) \in R$  ($R$ is the relation)
We can write $\mathbf a \ r\ b$ and it is read as 
**a has the relation r to b** 
or
**a and b are related with respect to the relation r**
