DHCP on a router

ip dhcp pool <name_of_pool>

Ex: ip dhcp pool lan

#define the network range
network 192.168.0.0 255.255.255.0
 
#define the default gateway (if any) that should be passed to the clients
default-router 192.168.0.1 

#define the DNS server (if any) that should be passed to the clients
dns-server 192.168.0.3 

#exit dhcp pool configuration
exit 

# If there any IPs in that range that you do not want to be served to PCs - add them to the excluded range:
ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.0.1         #(for a single IP)

#or

ip dhcp excluded–address 192.168.0.1 192.168.0.10    #(for a range of IPs)

------------------------------------------------------------

NAT Configuration on a router

enable
conf t
interface FastEthernet 0/0

#specify that this is an inside interface. The interface needs to have an IP Address
ip nat inside


exit


#define Serial 0/0/0 as WAN (outside) interface
interface Serial 0/0/0
ip nat outside

exit

#Define an Access list with the addresses from the inside that can be nat-ted. 
#The 0.0.0.31 specify the masks of bits from the IP Address that can vary. 
#In our example bellow all addresses between 192.168.0.1 – 192.168.0.31 would pass !
# these are simple one liner lists
access-list 1 permit 192.168.0.1 0.0.0.31


# Define the NAT policy. The NAT policy applies NAT by selecting a source and
# a NAT pool or single IP (which replace the private range)
#Overload allows to use a single outside IP from the defined pool for multiple 
#clients – by altering the port. One port is allocated on that IP for each outgoing client. Overload allows this behavior.

ip nat inside source list 1 pool ISP overload

RIP – configuration
In order to configure RIPv2 on a router we need to:

#go in admin mode, configuration
enable
config t

#enable RIP protocol on the router
route rip

#enable RIPv2
version 2

#specifiy the networks that we advertise to remote routers one by one
network 192.168.0.0
network 10.0.1.0
network 10.0.2.0

NAT – configuration
#Access lists are a mechanism that helps selecting IP traffic according to
#some rules (IP addresses – source or destination and protocol) either for 
#implementing a basic packet filtering (firewall) or to be selected for some action.  
#You will need to use them to select which communicating parties are candidate to NAT 
#from each local network.  Extended access-lists contain multiple rules read in order 
#and having the first matching rule apply the fate of the packet.

#to select traffic that won’t be affected where the access list is applied put use deny.
# To allow traffic to be selected use permit. Both versions use a source and destion specifiers. 
#Select to not apply to = deny traffic from 192.168.0.0-192.168.0.127  to 192.168.0.0-192.168.0.255. 
#The list bellow selects traffic between 192.168.0.0/25 to all other IPs except the range 192.168.0.0/24.

conf t
ip access-list extended nat
10 deny ip 192.168.0.0 0.0.0.127 192.168.0.0 0.0.0.255
